A Microblogging As A Service (MAAS) platform built on a webscale
microservice-based backend.

## What is Microblogging As A Service?
MAAS, or Microblogging As A Service, is the hottest new trend in the
blogosphere!  Want to run your own blog, but freaked out about all those
Wordpress vulnerabilities?  Like to share your thoughts, but too ~~lazy~~ busy
too write a full-length blogpost?  Well have we got the solution for you!

Skitter's innovative MAAS platform allows you to share your thoughts will all
of your (RIT account-holding) friends and followers!  Just tap together a quick
140-character response, forget any geopolitical consequences that may arise
from what you just composed, and hit that "skit" button!

## How do you make money?
Monetization is not a priority right now.  Our mission statement involves
pushing out an MVP in two months and then getting bought out by one of the Big
Names in tech.  It worked for so many other startups, so why not us?

We promise not to collect any data on you to sell to advertisers.  Probably.
Maybe.  Depends on how much money we blow on our launch party.

## What is your stance on diversity?
We at Skitter believe that diversity is a quality that should be found at the
most core of every online platform.  Most applications use one or two - three
if you're lucky - different application frameworks.  Not us.  Here at Skitter,
we take pride in our massively diversified microservice infrastructure.  We've
got 'em all - Flask, Node.js, Spring, AngularJS, Ruby on Rails, and everyone's
favorite - PHP.  Our engineers may disagree with this, but we strongly believe
that microservice diversity with Make Applications Great Again.
